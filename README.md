# Veggie-Code
A project management tool developed to keep users within VSCode and organized.

Introduces a variety of snippets to allow for quicker formatting of project management text and code organization.

Snippet prefixes all contain "!v" and will work by hitting the "Tab" key after choosing which prefix to use.

To get started, use "!veggiecode" to see all possible snippets and their descriptions.

Happy managing!
