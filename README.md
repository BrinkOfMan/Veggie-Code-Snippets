# Veggie-Code
A project management tool developed to keep users within VSCode and organized.

Introduces a variety of snippets to allow for quicker formatting of project management and code organization.

Snippets prefixes all contain "!v" and will work by hitting the "Tab" key after choosing which prefix to use.

Happy managing!
